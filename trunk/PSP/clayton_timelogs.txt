defect log:

		- date: Feb 23, 2013
		  type: Conceptual
		  fix time: 5
		  comment: I found it difficult to create word/hint pairs just based on a space as a delimiter, since hints could have zero or more spaces in them. I fixed this by using the '>' character as a delimiter to seperate word/hint pairs in the input text file.
