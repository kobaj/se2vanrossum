Programming word games with ACL2

The goal of this project is to create a wordsearch generator, game, and solver all with the purely functional Lisp based language ACL2. A web frontend is provided for ease of use, and a Hill Climbing AI algorithm runs execution in the backend.

Users can enter in as many words as they would like to generate a wordsearch.

Here is a generated board that can be played.

Or users can enter in a wordsearch and the words to be found within it.

And have the wordsearch solved for them.
